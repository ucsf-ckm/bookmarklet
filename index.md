## What is a Bookmarklet?
A bookmarklet is just a bookmark amped up on javascript. To add one on your iPad or iPhone, you will need to complete three stages:

1. Check Settings for Safari
2. Create a **bookmark**
3. Go back and edit to add javascript code to make it a **bookmarklet**

*Mobile browsers require several taps and some copy-paste to install a bookmarklet, but if you take a few minutes to set it up, the mobile version is easy to use. *

## Part One: Setup
1. On iPad, go to Settings and tap **Safari**
2. Set **Show Favorites Bar** > ON
3. iPhone has no favorites bar, so skip and go to Part Two.

*You can control what appears in your iPad Favorites Bar by opening Safari and tapping the bookmarks icon (open book) in the upper right and tapping Edit.*

## Part Two: Creating the Bookmark
1. Open **Safari** browser and view [this page](.)
2. Tap on the **share icon** ![share icon](img/share-icon.png)
3. Tap **Bookmark** to save this page ![bookmark icon](img/bookmark-icon.png)
4. Ensure that it will be saving to **Locations** > **Favorites** and then tap **Done**

## Part Three: Editing the Bookmarklet
1. Select and copy the bookmarklet code at bottom of this page
2. Tap the **bookmarks icon** ![bookmark no text](img/bookmark-icon-notext.png) and tap **Edit**
3. Select the bookmark saved in Part Two, called **Reload via EZproxy**
4. Tap the **address/URL field** and clear it by tapping the **x**
5. Tap on the word **Address**, and tap **Paste** to add the javascript code
6. Tap **Done** twice: once in the keyboard and once at lower corner of the Favorites box

## Using the Bookmarklet
1. Open Safari: on iPad you now have a visible **Favorites Bar** below the URL/Address line with **Reload via EZproxy** bookmarklet. On iPhone there is no bar, but tap **Bookmarks icon** to view)
2. NOTE: Bookmarklet is only needed if you go *directly* to a journal rather than through the UCSF Library website.
3. If you've clicked to view a full article and you are not granted access, tap the bookmarklet and you will be prompted to log in with your MyAccess credentials.
4. Once authenticated as UCSF, you should get the full text.
